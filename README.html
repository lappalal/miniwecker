<h5 id="anewstartforanoldorganisation">a new start for an old organisation</h5>

<p>This is a new webpage for the Kath. Jugend Gauting - KJG in short. KJG is a youth organisation in my town under the catholic church. They take children and teens between the ages of 9 and 16 under their wings and hold weekly get-togethers with them. It mostly is about the fun in it, yet I&#8217;ve seen more than one case were children with unfavourable backgrounds have found a connection and a place to go within the organisation.</p>

<p>KJG has had a Website (<a href="miniwecker.de">http://miniwecker.de</a>) as early as 2006, yet since then it never has been remodelled or updated in any way that was not a new blogpost. The site was dying of old age. A bunch of technologies used, where simply no longer supported, or misused in the development process, which resulted in a buggy legacy software. Photo uploading is not possible since last year, updates to the blog of the site had to be done through a direct database query, since the editor broke. So I took it upon myself to create a new design and build them a website that will hold it&#8217;s own for a while.</p>

<p>To not grow insane doing repetitive tasks I used the _s (<a href="underscores.me">http://underscores.me</a>) base theme as a starting point and built upon that.</p>

<p>You can find a functioning demo at <a href="kjg1.delphinus.uberspace.de">http://kjg1.delphinus.uberspace.de</a></p>
